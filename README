1. Fristly, install rails in your system. A quick googling will guide you with precise instructions to install rails inyou linux/Windows/Mac.

2. Install phpmyadmin in your local server.

3. Once you clone the repo onto your system, enter the repo folder from your terminal/cmd and the run "bundle install". This will install all dependencies['gems'] onto your local project.

4. After installing all dependencies, we now need to set up or DB environment for the app.
Run "rake db:create" & "rake db:migrate" to set up your DB and all its tables. after a successful migration of our DB schema, when you take a look at the phpmyadmin console, you will see a DB named "tweet_development" in your databases list and all its tables created and seeded.

5. If the rake process gives any trouble, goto "config/database.yml" file and edit your phpmyadmin login username & password. Usually they are set to "root" & "root" respectively so a rails app is usually precomfigured for them. If you have any other credentials, update them in the file.

6. now that we have set up our DB environment, Its time to run our project now. run "rails server -p [port_number]". for instance "rails server -p 4000". Your Rails app is up and running on "http://localhost:4000/" or "http://127.0.0.1:4000/" or "http://lvh.me:4000/"



If you face any problem setting up rails or in running our rails app, "You can contact me at iambadekar@gmail.com" or you can contact me on the mobile number that you already have.

Thanks
